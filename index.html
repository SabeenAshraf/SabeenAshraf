             <img src="p2p-lending.png" alt="P2P Lending Project">
            <h3>A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach to P2P Lending</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Built predictive models to assess loan default risk on P2P lending platforms using the Bondora dataset (2009–2023), addressing data imbalance, outlier detection, and model explainability. Applied extensive preprocessing (capping, encoding, normalization), feature selection (RFECV, feature importance), and evaluated 14 models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and AutoGluon. The best-performing model, XGBoost-SMOTE-HYP, achieved AUC of 74.78%, with strong generalization and minimal overfitting. Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, LIME) provided global and local interpretability, identifying key risk factors such as liabilities, education level, and borrower type enhancing transparency and decision-making in loan risk evaluation.</p></div>
      
      <div class="card"><img src="cancer-detection.png" alt="Cancer Detection Project"><h3>Deep Learning-Based Cancer Detection Using Microscopic Histology Images </h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Built a breast cancer classification model using the BACH dataset, comprising 400 high-resolution H&E-stained histology images equally distributed across four classes: normal, benign, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. Performed manual train-test split, image format conversion, resizing, and custom preprocessing to prepare data for model training. Leveraged transfer learning with ResNet50, InceptionV3, and a custom CNN combined with data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Achieved a strong AUROC of 93.7%, demonstrating the model's ability to detect cancerous patterns with high accuracy. The project highlights the importance of preprocessing in small medical datasets and showcases the power of deep learning in histopathological image analysis.</p></div>
